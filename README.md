# Social Network API
 The objective is to build an API for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage connections. The API will be built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and the Mongoose ODM for data modeling.

## Introduction

In the digital age, social networking platforms are a common way for users to connect, share experiences, and interact with each other. This project focuses on creating a backend API for a social network application. The API allows users to register, create and interact with posts, manage connections, and receive notifications.

## Technologies

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): A web application framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database used to store user data, posts, and other related information.
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose): An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- JavaScript Date Library (Optional): A library for formatting timestamps (or you can use the native JavaScript `Date` object).

## Features

The API provides the following features:

- User registration and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Posting thoughts with text and optional media attachments.
- Interacting with posts through likes, comments, and shares.
- Managing connections by sending and accepting friend requests.
- Notification system for new friend requests, post interactions, etc.
- Search functionality to find users and posts based on keywords or usernames.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-network-api.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your MongoDB connection in `config.js`.
